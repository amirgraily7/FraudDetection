# Fraud detection: Exploring feature extraction for predicting fraudulent activity of the first transaction of a new user.

This repo exemplifies feature extraction from raw dataset for building machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions occurring in e-commerce websites. The original dataset contains all activities of a new user visiting a website, including sign-up time, purchase time, purchase value, ip address, device id, source, age and sex. Most of these activity records do not show patterns modelable by machine learning algorithms, which need either feature transformation or feature extraction for ML to learn and then predict. 

#Background
  
  Transaction in e-commerce websites has high risk of users performing fraudulent activities such as doing money laundry, using stolen identity and credit card, etc. due to unscreened and diversified background of users. The rise in artificial intelligent (machine learning in specific) enables to detect these fraudulent activities with accuracy and real-time. However, the activities and background of a new user visiting a website (called data) are usually not directly learnable by machine learning algorithms. Feature extraction from activity records and feature transformation from user's background are a necessity as well as a prerequisite for building a machine learning model.
    
   In this repo, we have a dataset containing a website selling clothes and the first transaction activities of new users. The users' activity and background are collected when they visited and performed activities at the website. Here the purpose is to build a model to predict (in real time) whether a new user is performing fraudulent activity. Also, based on model outputs, what kind of users' experience could be recommended to the website.

#Feature extraction

  The raw data has the columns of user id, signup time, purchase time, device id, source, browser, sex, age, ip address, class, and country. Features including user id, source, browser, sex, age, and country can be classified as identity characteristics, which can be directly transformed for machine learning modeling. However, features including signup time, purchase time, device id, and ip address are activity-based that do not carry machine-recoganizable patterns as themselves. Rather, we could extract much more valuable characteristics from these than identity characteristics for machine learning modeling, since it is the activity differentiating one user from the other that could teach and train a model. So what active features can be extracted?
  
  |signup_time|purchase_time|purchase_value|device_id|browser|age|ip_address|country|
  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
  |1.0|0.997135|0.000807|0.912939|0.000033|0.00038|0.94970|0.001198|  
  
Table 1. Data's uniqueness in each column from the original dataset. 
  
  1). The original signup time and purchase time are random, continuous and 100% unique, but the time difference ("time_diff") between signup time and purchase time may show characteristics of fraudulent activity, such as flash transaction suggesting automative trading, a constant time difference may also suggest fraudulent automotive trading, etc.
  2). The ip address itself again does not carry characteristics for modeling (~95% data uniqueness). However, if many users use the same ip address, it may suggest fraudulent activity. Thus, we can extract feature of "ip_users" (how many unique users use the same ip address?).
  3). Similarly, that many users use the same device for transaction suggests high possibility of fraudulent activity. Thus, we can create feature of "device_id_unique_users" (how many unique users use the same device_id for transaction?).
  4). From signup time and purchase time, we can also create features of what day / week transactions are more frequently occurred. If there were traceable patterns of transactions occuring, it again shows more possibility of fraudulent activities. Thus, we could create features of "week_of_the_day" and "week_of_the_year" for both signup time and purchase time.
  5). Besides, since device_id can be shared by many unique users, "total_purchase" and/or "average_purchase" for each device_id may also imply whether activities are fraudulent or not.
  6). Fraudulent activities might occur more frequently in a particular region (country here). So, having a feature showing number of users ('country_count') from the same country might be useful (or redundant). Also, since there are over 200 countries, we may use 'country_count' to bin those countries showing relatively less entries, say, less than 200, as a single group.

  After data preprocessing and split of train and test data, we can feed the data to machine learning models. Here we build both RandomForest and XGBoost models. Overall, two models result in very good performance (table 2), in particular predicting almost unity precision. However, recall has been sacrificed with the threshold (0.5) for perfect precision (almost no false negatives). Rather, receiver operating characteristics (roc) curve provides a threshold-independent measurement of evaluating model performance. As shown in Figure 1. generally both models perform well and show auc ~0.85. If we want to minimize false negatives, default threshold (0.5) works well (like the predictions from the two models). Well, if we want to maximize true positives, we can decrease threshold to predict more positives, though at the expense of predicting more false positives.

  To evaluate the importance / usefulness of features extracted, we output feature importances from both models. As shown in Table 3, the extracted features are almost listed as the top 10 most important features in both models, suggesting that they are well learned by machine learning models. In real business world, there are always a tradeoff between computation speed and model accuracy due to the big amount of data. Can we select a few most important features for modeling to get comparable results as models built with full features? We re-built the RandomForest and XGBoost models using their top 15 most important features. Surprisingly and favorably, as shown in Table 2, there are almost no penalty with less features.

#Summary and business suggestion

  We demonstrated feature extraction from original business dataset and built models using these features with excellent generalization capacity. The feature importances from the models confirm that the extracted features contribute the most for model learning and prediction.
  
  We also show that models using selected the most important features result in comparable prediction capability as those with full features. Given that we have a model enabling to predict the probability of committing a fraudulent activity, we may create different user experience:
  1). If a user fraudulent probability is less than a threshold X, the user will have normal experience;
  2). If a user fraudulent probability is larger than X but lower than a highly-suspicious threshold Y, the user can be directed to a page asking for additional verification via SMS / socical network account like Facebook;
  3). If a user fraudulent probability is larger than Y, then this user should be prohibited or at least put on hold to check his / her login data for further decision.
